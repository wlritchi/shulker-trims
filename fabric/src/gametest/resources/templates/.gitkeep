# Golden image templates for client game tests
#
# Template images are stored here and compared against during test runs.
# The Fabric Client Game Test API uses these as reference images.
#
# To generate/update templates:
# 1. Delete the template file(s) you want to regenerate
# 2. Run: xvfb-run -a ./gradlew :fabric:runClientGameTest
# 3. The new templates will be saved here automatically
# 4. Review the generated images and commit them
#
# Template comparison uses Mean Squared Difference with 1% tolerance
# to handle minor GPU/driver rendering variations.
